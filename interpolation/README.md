# Interpolation Algorithm

## Brief
This algorithm takes some ponts as input and also the value of an unknown function on 
these points and then calculates the value of the unknown function on a new point 

## My code works as follow:
- It takes input from file "input.txt" whose first line contains the number of inputs
 provided. Then comes the points and the values of an unknown function at those points.
 Thes last number is thepoint on which we need to calculate the value of the function.
- After calculating the value of the function at that point the value is written in the
 file "output.txt".
