# Muller's Algorithm
## Brief
- This algorithm calculates the root of the function by taking three points from the number line.
- These three points should not be on the same side of the number line atleast one should be on 
the other side.
## My code works as follow:
- You can edit the function with the name "func"in the file "main.c" to whichever function's root 
you wish to calculate.
- It takes the input from the file "input.txt" which contains three points.
- It calculates the root and writes it in te file "output.txt".
