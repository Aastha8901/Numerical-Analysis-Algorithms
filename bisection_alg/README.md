## Bisection Algorithm
-It is an algorithm which checks whether the function has a root in a given interval and also compute that root.

## My code works a follow:
-Inside the main.c file there is a function with the name "func" which you can edit to whichever function's root
you want to calculate.
-The code takes the input from the file "input.txt". This file generally consist of two number of float datatype
which is the range in which we want to calculate the root of the function.
-The output is then written in the file with the title "output.txt".
